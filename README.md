# BTC-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP
Bitcoin is one of the most trending crypto currency due to its price fluctuation phenomena. 
On the other hand, scientist now recognizing the power of predicting the sentiments base on the tweets for different events, political crisis and specially for economy.  
The sentiment of tweets on Tweeter about crypto currency directly or indirectly recognize the overall behavior of Bitcoin. 
In the proposed work, we train different machine learning models a deep learning model (BERT) for the sentiment prediction of tweets about Bitcoin. 
The model takes the tweets and predict their sentiment to analyze future behavior of Bitcoin. 
We used the Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector machine algorithms for the classification of tweets. 
We also used the pre-trained BERT model from the transformer library for sentiment classification that has the highest accuracy.
